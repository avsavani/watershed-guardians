## Watershed Guardians Data

See live demo at: [http://data.thewatershedguardians.org](http://data.thewatershedguardians.org).

The *watershed guardians* is a web application that serves the county of Monterey by helping local residents understand the impacts of climate change on the Carmel river watershed by using maps and graphs.

## Motivation
I was working at the watershed and saw the impact that the river has on the local population. The water,agriculture and tourism industry all depend on the river as a source of water but don't understand the impact that climate change can have on the water source and how it can affect their personal lives. I wanted to build this project to hopefully project a visual understanding of **why this matters**.

## Code style
 [Airbnb/JSX](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react)
 
## How to use
You can see the map of the Carmel river region, which has markers for each test site.

When you click on a marker for the test site, you can see the data accumulated for that point. We've included 4 test data for each location. Each test data point corresponds to river health in some way.
